                    For Help Me Find service: In order to serve you better and deliver on time without excuses, we
                    charge a very little amount (commitment fee) which is less than 2% of interested property price.
                    Furthermore, the amount you pay as commitment fee is non-refundable but will be deducted from the
                    amount you are required to pay as commission after buying or renting the property in point.

                <p>
                    You may pay a commitment fee and the property deal may not be concluded at the end due to many
                    factors such as: no needing the said property anymore, not having enough money for the property
                    found for you etc. if that is the case, you can be rest assured that we have no interest in cheating
                    you out of you already paid commitment fee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a commitment to judiciously utilize every commitment fee because we have high respect for
                    integrity and we care that it's your hard earned money, therefore we give details on how your money
                    was spent and will add any remaining balance to your account with us.

                    users to be very careful and make adequate inquiry about a particular property before making any

                    For properties listed by us (Solid Agents), we verify and authenticate them ourselves to ensure that

                    relevant factors.
